<p><img src="img/karen.jpg">Have you felt anxious or depressed, haunted by memories of the past? Do you harbor resentments? Do you tell yourself that you should “just get over it?” If you’re like most people, you have self-limiting beliefs which hold you back. Thoughts are energetic! They create our perceptions which then create our reality.</p>

<p>The reason your discomfort and distress stay with you is because the energy of your thoughts and emotions is still living in your body, holding you hostage and limiting your ability to respond to life events in a healthier way.</p>

<p>After many years of doing “talk therapy,” I discovered the relatively new field of Energy Psychology (EP) which has changed my life, the style of my clinical practice and the results clients are seeing on a regular basis. The premise of EP is that all discomfort and disease are the result of energetic blocks and imbalances, many of which are caused by negative thought patterns and unprocessed emotions from the past. EP interventions draw upon Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and ancient wisdom of Chinese medicine, specifically, acupressure.</p>

<p>Since discovering EP, I have trained in Thought Field Therapy (TFT), the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Tapas Acupressure Technique (TAT), and the Emotion Code (EC), Energy Medicine and Prepare for Surgery, Heal Faster. These powerful and graceful interventions are designed to relieve the mind and body of the effects of negative thoughts, perceptions, emotions and self-limiting beliefs which keep us from living the life we were meant to live. The extra benefit of these modalities is that they offer tools which can also be used at home.</p>

<p>While Energy Psychology has been shown to have a positive impact on all conditions, my experience has been with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>phobias</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>grief</li>
<li>PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder)</li>
<li>guilt/shame</li>
<li>depression</li>
<li>stress</li>
<li>anger & resentment</li>
<li>emotional eating</li>
<li>self-esteem</li>
<li>self-limiting beliefs</li>
<li>OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)</li>
<li>physical pain</li>
</ul>

<p>EP interventions have also been proven effective with urges and cravings associated with drug and alcohol addiction. Individuals who are actively engaged in the addiction process or who have eating disorders should seek the help of a specialized clinic.</p>

<p>My practice serves primarily adults. I work with children and teens on a case-by-case basis for anxiety and phobia concerns.</p>

<p>As we work together, it is important for me to hold a safe space for you to tell your story. When you are ready, I will introduce these cutting edge interventions to help you find relief and a sense of peace. Kinesiology, better known as energy testing or muscle testing, is a way to communicate with your unconscious mind and is used in addition to the guidance you and I receive from our intuitions and conscious awareness to identify topics to address and interventions to use. You will learn how to move trapped energy out of your mind, body and spirit, freeing you up to become the person you were meant to be ~ more creative and able to enjoy the blessings of a full life!</p>

<p>Clients using insurance meet with me in my Northboro office. Self-pay clients have the choice of working in Northboro or Sterling or via Skype or telephone.</p>
